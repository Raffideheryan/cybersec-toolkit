# üõ†Ô∏è CyberSec Toolkit

A collection of small but powerful Python scripts (and one Ruby module) built for learning, practicing, and experimenting with cybersecurity techniques. From scanning networks to cracking hashes ‚Äî everything you need to sharpen your offensive security skills in one place.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational use only.** Do **NOT** use these tools against any network, system, or application you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## üìÅ What's Inside?

| Script                         | Description                                                              |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `network_scanner.py`          | Scans local IP ranges and ports to find active hosts and services.      |
| `dir_enum.py`                 | Enumerates directories on a web server using a wordlist.                |
| `subdomain_finder.py`         | Brute-forces and discovers subdomains of a target domain.               |
| `ssh_bruteforce.py`           | Attempts SSH login using a list of passwords (via Paramiko).            |
| `hash_identifier.py`          | Identifies hash types based on their length and structure.              |
| `hash_cracker.py`             | Cracks known hashes using dictionary attacks (supports MD5).            |
| `log_analyzer.py`             | Parses logs and flags potentially suspicious activity.                  |
| `phishing_detector.py`        | Detects phishing emails based on keywords and suspicious links.         |
| `bruter.rb` (Metasploit)      | A custom Ruby Metasploit module template you can load and test.         |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Some scripts may require extra libraries:

```bash
pip install requests paramiko

üîß Usage
Each script can be run individually. Here are some examples:

Copy
Edit
# Scan the 192.168.1.x network
python3 network_scanner.py

# Run directory enumeration against a target
python3 dir_enum.py

# Brute-force SSH on a given host
python3 ssh_bruteforce.py
